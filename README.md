# EHR-dApp

## Description

Electronic Health Record Decentralized Application (EHR-dApp) is a web application that helps pacients and doctors to manage electronic health records in a decentralized way.
We are trying to apply the EHR systems logic to Blockchain architecture, of course, on a proof of concept level.

<h3> Technologies used: </h3>

    <li> <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask, </a>a gateway between browser and blockchain</li>
  </ul>

## Arhitecture
The application constists of two main modules, the first one provides the user interface and the second one provides the Blockchain. This two main modules are connected by a third module which is a bridge between browser and Blockchain
